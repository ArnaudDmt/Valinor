Reviewer #2: The authors proposed a lightweight estimator for humanoid robots. By combining Leg odometry with the Tilt Observer, a computationally efficient complementary filter which provides accurate estimates of the IMU's tilt and linear velocity is developed. Authors presented an evaluation of the proposed estimator through real-world data on two humanoid robots. The reviewer has the following comments:
1. It is unclear how the forces in equation (1) were obtained. How were the forces along with x, y, and z axes computed from the tangential force at the contact?
2. If the forces were measured using sensors, detailed information about the sensors should be provided in Section of 7.1 (Description of the experiments).
3. Should lambda_1 be used instead of lambda_2 in equation (14) for the interpolation? Please clarify.
4. The authors should include figures for Experiment 2, similar to Figs. 2 and 4. Additionally, presenting tilt and yaw estimation results over time (as in Fig. 4) would improve clarity and help readers better understand the results.
