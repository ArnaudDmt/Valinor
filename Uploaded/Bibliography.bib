Unlike vision-based state estimators, proprioceptive state estimators are agnostic to perceptually degraded situations such as dark or foggy scenes. While some robots are equipped with dedicated physical sensors to detect necessary contact data for state estimation, some robots do not have dedicated contact sensors, and the addition of such sensors is non-trivial without redesigning the hardware. The trained network can estimate contact events on different terrains. The experiments show that a contact-aided invariant extended Kalman filter can generate accurate odometry trajectories compared to a state-of-the-art visual SLAM system, enabling robust proprioceptive odometry.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a novel nonlinear state estimation framework for humanoid robots based on the dynamics of the center of mass (CoM) and dual-loop Kalman filter(DLKF). It effectively fuses the information from inertial measurement unit(IMU), joint encoders, and foot sensitive resistors (FSRs), and provides state estimates for various gait generation algorithms and dynamic balance controllers with CoM or divergence component of motion (DCM) feedback. Compared to the widely used linear models such as the linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM), the nonlinear dynamics of CoM effectively reduce the process error. However, the humanoid robot is a highly complex dynamic system with multiple links and joints, the dynamics of CoM are also a simplification of the whole body dynamics. As a result, it brings non-zero-mean, non-Gaussian, and correlated process error, which the conventional extend Kalman filter (EKF) cannot handle. To this end, the DLKF is adopted to compensate the process error, thus the estimator is robust to the modeling error caused by simplifications. Furthermore, the invariant extended Kalman filter (IEKF) is used for floating base kinematics estimation, and the force/torque (F/T) sensor which is difficult to integrate on smaller or cheaper robots due to the size and cost is not used in our framework. Finally, our nonlinear state estimation framework improves the accuracy of CoM and DCM estimation in a virtual environment simulation using our self-developed Defensor hydraulic humanoid robot.},

The configuration of a floating base system like a humanoid robot usually requires the knowledge of an additional six degrees of freedom which describes its base position-and-orientation. This quantity usually cannot be measured and needs to be estimated. A matrix Lie group, encapsulating the position-and-orientation and linear velocity of the base link, feet positions-and-orientations and Inertial Measurement Units’ biases, is used to represent the state while relative positions-and-orientations of contact feet from forward kinematics are used as observations. The proposed estimator exhibits fast convergence for large initialization errors owing to choice of uncertainty parametrization. An experimental validation is done on the iCub humanoid platform.},

  abstract = {It is significantly challenging to develop biped robots, such as a humanoid robot, that can walk stably in complex environments, such as a rough terrain or slope. Additionally, various kinds of sensors are required. Force and torque (FT) and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors are necessary for a humanoid robot to achieve stable biped walking, and it is especially difficult to realize such locomotion without an IMU sensor in complex environments, such as a slope. Therefore, a new walking algorithm is needed so that a humanoid robot is able to walk well on a slope, even if the IMU sensor is damaged. This paper proposes a slope observer that can estimate the angle of the robot, angular velocity, and slope angle without an IMU sensor, as well as a controller for posture control and stabilization on a slope. The slope observer was developed based on a disturbance observer that can estimate the angle of the robot, angular velocity, and disturbance applied to the robot using only an FT sensor. The controller was designed as state feedback control based on the slope observer. Furthermore, the posture control was designed considering the slope angle such that the robot can always stand upright on the slope. The proposed slope observer and controller were verified with certain experiments performed in the lab, and the walking experiment of a real humanoid robot RoK-3 performed on the unknown slope.

  abstract     = {The future where the industrial shop-floors witness humans and robots working in unison and the
domestic households becoming a shared space for both these agents is not very far. The scientific
community has been accelerating towards that future by extending their research efforts in human-
robot interaction towards human-robot collaboration. It is possible that the anthropomorphic nature
of the humanoid robots could deem the most suitable for such collaborations in semi-structured,
human-centered environments. Wearable sensing technologies for human agents and efficient human-
aware control strategies for the humanoid robot will be key in achieving a seamless human-humanoid
collaboration. This is where reliable state estimation strategies become crucial in making sense of the
information coming from multiple distributed sensors attached to the human and those on the robot to
augment the feedback controllers designed for the humanoid robot to aid their human counterparts.
In this context, this thesis investigates the theory of Lie groups for designing state estimation
techniques aimed towards humanoid locomotion and human motion estimation. The abstract nature
of Lie theory provides a unified approach to handle the three-dimensional machinery and the complex
geometry required for modeling free-floating, highly articulated multi-body systems. It enables
suitably appropriate methods to perform rigorous calculus over complex nonlinear spaces and to
handle the notion of uncertainties in such spaces, which are important for an estimator design.
Methods for loosely-coupled and tightly-coupled sensor fusion for floating base estimation of
a humanoid robot are presented through the theory of averaging and filtering on Lie groups. The
problem of human motion estimation through wearable sensing technologies is tackled through a
combination of dynamical systems’ theory-based Inverse Kinematics and filtering on Lie groups,
demonstrated to be directly applicable also for humanoid state estimation. Experimental validations
of the estimators for humanoid base estimation and human motion estimation have been carried out
on simulated datasets and datasets collected from real-world experiments conducted on the iCub
humanoid robot and Xsens Motion capture technology, respectively.},

In this way, we extend our robot model to take link deflections into account as underactuated extra degrees of freedom, allowing us to design a whole-body controller capable to anticipate deformations. Since in a real scenario, the deflection is not directly measurable, we present an observer aiming at estimating the flexible joint state, namely position, velocity, and torque, only considering the measured contact force and the state of actuated joint. We validate the overall approach in simulations with the humanoid robot TALOS, whose hip is mechanically flexible due to a localized mechanical weakness. Furthermore, the paper compares the proposed whole-body control strategy with state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, we analyze the performance of the estimator in the case of different values of hip elasticity.},

A nonlinear observability analysis is performed on both the point-foot and flat-foot filters and it is concluded that the addition of rotational constraints significantly simplifies singular cases and improves the observability characteristics of the system. Results on a simulated walking dataset demonstrate the performance gain of the flat-foot filter as well as confirm the results of the presented observability analysis.},

It reconciles the rigid kinematics, given by joint encoders, with attitude measurements obtained from several IMUs, through a kinematic model incorporating the flexibilities. Compared to previous works, no dynamic model of the flexibilities is employed. For illustration, the estimator is successfully tested on the exoskeleton Atalante, both in static and while walking.

Recent research in pedestrian tracking has shown that motion can be inferred from inertial data using convolutional neural networks. A learned inertial displacement measurement can improve state estimation in challenging scenarios where leg odometry is unreliable, such as slipping and compressible terrains. Our work learns to estimate a displacement measurement from IMU data which is then fused with traditional leg odometry. Our approach greatly reduces the drift of proprioceptive state estimation, which is critical for legged robots deployed in vision and lidar denied environments such as foggy sewers or dusty mines. We compared results from an EKF and an incremental fixed-lag factor graph estimator using data from several real robot experiments crossing challenging terrains. Our results show a reduction of relative pose error by 37% in challenging scenarios when compared to a traditional kinematic-inertial estimator without learned measurement. We also demonstrate a 22% reduction in error when used with vision systems in visually degraded environments such as an underground mine.},

structure of its environment. This is achieved by means of an
Observability Constrained Extended Kalman Filter that fuses
kinematic encoder data with on-board IMU measurements. By
including the absolute position of all footholds into the filter
state, simple model equations can be formulated which accurately
capture the uncertainties associated with the intermittent ground
contacts. The resulting filter simultaneously estimates the position
of all footholds and the pose of the main body. In the algorithmic
formulation, special attention is paid to the consistency of the
linearized filter: it maintains the same observability properties
as the nonlinear system, which is a prerequisite for accurate state
estimation. The presented approach is implemented in simulation
and validated experimentally on an actual quadrupedal robot.},

  abstract = {Legged robots require knowledge of pose and velocity in order to maintain stability and execute walking paths. Current solutions either rely on vision data, which is susceptible to environmental and lighting conditions, or fusion of kinematic and contact data with measurements from an inertial measurement unit (IMU). In this work, we develop a contact-aided invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) using the theory of Lie groups and invariant observer design. This filter combines contact-inertial dynamics with forward kinematic corrections to estimate pose and velocity along with all current contact points. We show that the error dynamics follows a log-linear autonomous differential equation with several important consequences: (a) the observable state variables can be rendered convergent with a domain of attraction that is independent of the system’s trajectory; (b) unlike the standard EKF, neither the linearized error dynamics nor the linearized observation model depend on the current state estimate, which (c) leads to improved convergence properties and (d) a local observability matrix that is consistent with the underlying nonlinear system. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to include IMU biases, add/remove contacts, and formulate both world-centric and robo-centric versions. We compare the convergence of the proposed InEKF with the commonly used quaternion-based extended Kalman filter (EKF) through both simulations and experiments on a Cassie-series bipedal robot. Filter accuracy is analyzed using motion capture, while a LiDAR mapping experiment provides a practical use case. Overall, the developed contact-aided InEKF provides better performance in comparison with the quaternion-based EKF as a result of exploiting symmetries present in system.},

However, despite hybrid dynamical systems becoming increasingly important in many fields, there has been little work on utilizing the knowledge of how probability distributions map through hybrid transitions. Here, we make use of a propagation law that employs the saltation matrix (a first-order update to the sensitivity equation) to create the Salted Kalman Filter (SKF), a natural extension of the Kalman Filter and Extended Kalman Filter to hybrid dynamical systems. Away from hybrid events, the SKF is a standard Kalman filter. When a hybrid event occurs, the saltation matrix plays an analogous role as that of the system dynamics, subsequently inducing a discrete modification to both the prediction and update steps. The SKF outperforms a naive variational update – the Jacobian of the reset map – by having a reduced mean squared error in state estimation, especially immediately after a hybrid transition event. Compared against a hybrid particle filter, the particle filter outperforms the SKF in mean squared error only when a large number of particles are used, likely due to a more accurate accounting of the split distribution near a hybrid transition.},

to a myriad of sub-problems, such as the hybrid dynamics of

Accurate and efficient state estimation of the floating base
and the feet joints can help alleviate much of these issues by
providing feedback information to robot controllers. Current
state estimation methods are highly reliant on a conjunction of
visual and inertial measurements to provide real-time estimates,
thus being handicapped in perceptually poor environments. In
this work, we show that by leveraging the kinematic chain
model of the robot via a factor graph formulation, we can

primarily proprioceptive inertial data. We perform state estima-

forward kinematic computations, and contact detections in a
factor-graph based framework, allowing our state estimate to
be constrained by the robot model. Experimental results in
simulation and on hardware show that our approach out-

27% on average, while being generalizable to a variety of legged

Moreover, precise estimation of the robot’s position and orien-

problem, we introduce a new state estimation algorithm which
we term Contact-Centric Leg Odometry (COCLO). This new
estimator uses a Square Root Unscented Kalman Filter (SR-
UKF) to fuse multiple proprioceptive sensors available on a
legged robot. In contrast to IMU-centric filtering approaches,
COCLO formulates prediction and measurement models ac-

has an indirect measurement model using joint velocities to
estimate the robot body velocity. In rough terrain, when
IMUs suffer from large amounts of noise, COCLO’s contact-
centric approach outperforms previous IMU-centric methods.
To demonstrate improved state estimation accuracy, we com-
pare COCLO with Visual Inertial Navigation System (VINS), a
state-of-the-art visual inertial odometry [13], in three different
environments: flat ground, ramps, and stairs. COCLO achieves
better estimation precision than VINS in all three environments

The proposed IEKF differs from existing techniques in literature on the account that it is derived using minimal tools from differential geometry that simplifies its representation and derivation to a large extent. The filter error dynamics is defined on the Lie algebra directly instead of identifying the Lie algebra with an Euclidean space or defining the error dynamics in local coordinates using exponential map, and the associated differential Riccati equations are described on the corresponding space of linear operators using tensor algebra. The proposed filter is implemented for the attitude dynamics of the rigid body, which is a benchmark problem in control, and its performance is compared against a conventional extended Kalman filter (EKF). Numerical experiments support that the IEKF is computationally less intensive and gives better performance than the EKF.},

are drift-free but they are sensitive to transverse accelerations and have slow dynamics.
This paper presents an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based data fusion algorithm which
utilizes the complementary noise profiles of these two types of sensors to extend their limits.
To avoid complexities of dynamic modelling of the platform and its interaction with the
environment, gyro modelling will be used to implement indirect (error state) form of the
Kalman filter. The great advantage of this approach is its independence from the structure of
the platform and its applicability to any system with a similar set of sensors. Separate bias
formulation of the Kalman filter will be used to reduce the computational complexity of the
algorithm. In addition, a systematic approach based on wavelet decomposition will be util-
ized to estimate noise covariances used in the Kalman filter formulation. This approach
solves many of the convergence problems encountered in the implementation of EKF due to
the choice of covariance matrices. Experimental implementation of the estimator shows the
excellent performance of the filter.},

In this paper we first generalize this result by characterizing the (much broader) class of systems for which this property holds.

Then, we leverage this “log-linear” property of the error evolution, to prove for those systems the local stability of the IEKF around any trajectory, under the standard conditions of the linear case.

Although they have shown great motion performance in recent years, most of them rely on high-performance sensors, especially force sensors settled on foot. However, it is impractical to select special forces sensors in the field environment, and the performance degradation and noise during the usage will bring fatal control defects. In order to solve this problem, we propose a foot contact force estimation method that does not require force sensors, and applies the estimated contact force to the impedance control of the legged robot to achieve the robot's active compliance control. The method of force estimation is based on the generalized momentum of the robot. It only needs to provide the position information of the joint and the information of the applied control torque. The designed feedforward and compensation terms effectively improve the speed and accuracy of the force estimation. We improved the response speed of the system to the contact force by improving the structure of the impedance control, and applied the estimated contact force to the impedance control to achieve the stable motion of the quadruped robot. Simulation experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed force estimation method.},

We provide new specific proofs of almost global Lyapunov asymptotic stability and local exponential convergence for this observer.

Dynamic ground pressure data from the sensors were collected using a small two-legged runner and used to train a support vector machine (SVM) terrain classifier. Results show that tactile sensing data, in combination with information about the motor torque and robot gait, are sufficient to distinguish among hard, slippery, grassy and granular terrain types with >90% accuracy in a single stride. The most useful classifier features include stride frequency, peak motor torque, and peak and average tactile sensor readings.},

In addition, this article made innovative attempt to compensate the optimal estimation of motion parameter error using feedback correction method, and finally obtained stable and accurate velocity estimation of robot. Being unrestricted by the number of robot’s leg, this method is suitable for both static gait and dynamic gait, and can overcome the impact from leg slipping. As for the verification of this method, in this article, a quadruped robot was employed for motion simulation and experimental verification, and results verified the correctness and feasibility of the proposed method.},

  abstract  = {This paper introduces and evaluates a family of new simple estimators to reconstruct the pose and velocity of the floating base. The estimation of the floating-base state is a critical challenge to whole-body control methods that rely on full-state information in high-rate feedback. Although the kinematics of grounded limbs may be used to estimate the pose and velocity of the body, modelling errors from ground irregularity, foot slip, and structural flexibilities limit the utility of estimation from kinematics alone. These difficulties have motivated the development of sensor fusion methods to augment body-mounted IMUs with kinematic measurements. Existing methods often rely on extended Kalman filtering, which lack convergence guarantees and may present difficulties in tuning. This paper proposes two new simplifications to the floating-base state estimation problem that make use of robust off-the-shelf orientation estimators to bootstrap development. Experiments for in-place balance and walking with the HRP-2 show that the simplifications yield results on par with the accuracy reported in the literature for other methods. As further benefits, the structure of the proposed estimators prevents divergence of the estimates, simplifies tuning, and admits efficient computation. These benefits are envisioned to help accelerate the development of baseline estimators in future humanoids.},

In the proposed observer, the external force is estimated using inertial sensors and foot force sensors based on simple but efficient modeling of the forces applied to the robot. This paper also shows the experiments of the proposed external force observer using a real humanoid robot HRP-2. The experimental results show that the proposed observer has satisfactory performance to estimate the external force with sufficient response and accuracy.},

With modern systems’ development, sensors can obtain more and more signals and store them. Therefore, how to use these measurement big data to improve the performance of state estimation has become a hot research issue in this field. This paper reviews the development of state estimation and future development trends. First, we review the model-based state estimation methods, including the Kalman filter, such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), cubature Kalman filter (CKF), etc. Particle filters and Gaussian mixture filters that can handle mixed Gaussian noise are discussed, too. These methods have high requirements for models, while it is not easy to obtain accurate system models in practice. The emergence of robust filters, the interacting multiple model (IMM), and adaptive filters are also mentioned here. Secondly, the current research status of data-driven state estimation methods is introduced based on network learning. Finally, the main research results for hybrid filters obtained in recent years are summarized and discussed, which combine model-based methods and data-driven methods. This paper is based on state estimation research results and provides a more detailed overview of model-driven, data-driven, and hybrid-driven approaches. The main algorithm of each method is provided so that beginners can have a clearer understanding. Additionally, it discusses the future development trends for researchers in state estimation.},

First of all, the concept and feature are paid attention to about Kalman filter, and its transmutative modes are taken into consideration. Then several popular neural network algorithms are introduced in brief. Subsequently, research results on hybrid models are analysed and discussed comprehensively. Not only Kalman filter and neural network can be adopted in succession, but also can be mixed in structure. The mixed models can also be divided into two types, the equations or parameters of state–space model are trained by neural network for Kalman filter and the parameters of neural network are updated by Kalman filter. It is proved that the hybrid models outperform than single model of Kalman filter or neural network in accuracy and generalization. Last but not least, the effectiveness of state–space equations of Kalman filter can be established by neural network in nonlinear systems is verified.},

The construction relies on an invariant frame (a classical notion) and on an invariant output-error, a less standard notion precisely defined here. Using the theory we build three non-linear observers for three examples of engineering interest: a non-holonomic car, a chemical reactor, and an inertial navigation system. For each example, the design is based on physical symmetries and the convergence analysis relies on the use of invariant state-errors, a symmetry-preserving way to define the estimation error.},

First, we show how to determine the transformation type to use in trajectory alignment based on the specific sensing modality (i.e., monocular, stereo and visual-inertial). Second, we describe commonly used error metrics (i.e., the absolute trajectory error and the relative error) and their strengths and weaknesses. To make the methodology presented for VO/VIO applicable to other setups, we also generalize our formulation to any given sensing modality. To facilitate the reproducibility of related research, we publicly release our implementation of the methods described in this tutorial.},

Most robots and autonomous vehicles depend on noisy data from sensors such as cameras or laser rangefinders to navigate in a three-dimensional world. This book presents common sensor models and practical advice on how to carry out state estimation for rotations and other state variables. It covers both classical state estimation methods such as the Kalman filter, as well as important modern topics such as batch estimation, the Bayes filter, sigmapoint and particle filters, robust estimation for outlier rejection, and continuous-time trajectory estimation and its connection to Gaussian-process regression. The methods are demonstrated in the context of important applications such as point-cloud alignment, pose-graph relaxation, bundle adjustment, and simultaneous localization and mapping. Students and practitioners of robotics alike will find this a valuable resource.},

Functional robustness was designed to use power cable and to wear a suit which can be changed by required functionality. Robustness of an action was achieved as a standing up action using “StateNet”, which realized autonomous error recovery.

The work is motivated by human-robot interaction scenarios, where ensuring safety is of primary concern whereas preserving task performance is an appealing secondary goal. Unexpected collisions may occur anywhere along the manipulator structure. Their fast detection is realized using our previous momentum-based method, which does not require any external sensing. The reaction torque applied to the joints reduces the effective robot inertia seen at the contact and lets the robot safely move away from the collision area. If we wish, however, to continue the execution of a Cartesian trajectory, robot redundancy can be exploited by projecting the reaction torque into the null space of a dynamic task matrix so as not to affect the original end-effector motion. This leads to the use of the so-called dynamically consistent approach to redundancy resolution, which is further elaborated in the paper. A partial task relaxation strategy can also be devised, with the objective of keeping contact forces below a user-defined safety threshold. Simulation results are reported for the 7R KUKA/DLR lightweight robot arm.},

Furthermore, among these three, there exists a unique optimum gait that maximizes static stability. This gait corresponds to the normal quadruped crawl favored by most animals for very low-speed locomotion.},

This idealization permits the construction of a general theory of locomotion equally applicable to animals and legged locomotion machines.

The method of measured synergy, offering the possibility of solving the problem of nominal dynamic regimes of regulator gait, is presented. On the basis of memorized nominal dynamic regimes, the control system is synthesized, making stable gait possible in the conditions of large perturbations. The essential result represents the control of stable gait by changing characteristic parameters of the system. The problem of postural stability of a biped system under large perturbations is also considered.},

As representative of the first group a six-legged locomotion machine is presented, having multilevel hierarchical type control systems, with some qualities of artificial intellect. As unstable type, biped locomotion systems are discussed. New approach to the synthesis of artificial biped gait is presented, together with control procedures for the cases of small and large perturbations.},
